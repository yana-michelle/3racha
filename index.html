He can easily be told apart from the rest by his unique raspy voice. He was one of the first three to be chosen by CB97 to be apart of Stray Kids, forming 3Racha with CB97.</h3></br></a></div>

            <section><h3>My <strong>personal</strong> top three favorite songs of their would be
    <br><ol><li><i>Start Line</i>-A song of the fear and excitment of ending one chapter in your life and starting the other.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPrh_8zBILc"><b>&#9728;Lyrics&#9728;</b></a></li><li><i>Matroshyka</i>- A song that is them syaing they are here to stay, no matter what people throw at them they won't just give up and disappear. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEwmc87yTpo"><b>&#9728;Lyrics&#9728;</b></a></li>
        <li><i>Wow</i>- This song is one of my favorites because of how embarrassed 3Racha are now when listening back on that song. The whole song is them trying to flirt with a girl but it really is quite cringey and dumb, both are the reasons I love it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf6a0XjexKw"><b>&#9728;Lyrics&#9728;</b></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5XU9-wpqNY"><sub>&#9734;their reaction, skip to 3:10.&#9734;</sub></a></li></ol></h3></section>
<footer><div><br><h4>3Racha took a break once they debuted as Stray Kids two years ago. The newest song they have now is fifty senconds long and titled Carpe Diem, released one month ago. Other than that they have been working hard as members of Stray Kids and producing and writing lyrics for them.</h4></div></footer>
